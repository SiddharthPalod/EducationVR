## How We Built It
EduVR was developed using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. Our tech stack includes React JSX for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for sleek and responsive design. We meticulously designed each feature to align with our vision of immersive education.

One of the significant challenges we faced was integrating codes from multiple creators who had used different technologies. This caused layout issues, but our team worked tirelessly to resolve them and create a cohesive platform.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
Our team is proud to have developed a fully-fledged educational website that aligns with our mission. We've achieved this in record time, demonstrating our commitment to making immersive education accessible to all.

## What We Learned
Throughout the development of EduVR, we learned valuable skills, including using Tailwind CSS and @mui for component design. We also gained a deep understanding of VR technology and its potential to transform education, enriching our vision for the project.

## What's Next for EduVR
EduVR is continuously evolving to provide an even more enriching learning experience. In the near future, we plan to implement the following enhancements:
- VR lectures for an entirely immersive classroom experience.
- A comprehensive student database to track progress and achievements.
- Expanding our library of interactive components to further our educational goals.

Join us on this exciting journey to reimagine education with the power of virtual reality. Together, we can make learning more engaging, effective, and accessible than ever before.
